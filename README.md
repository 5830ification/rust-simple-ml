## Simple Rust ML
This is a personal project for learning both Rust and machine learning.

Have a look at ``src/bin/main.rs`` for general structure, run with ``cargo run --release``. (I highly recommend running as a release build as performance is _subpar_).

Refer to [this amazing free book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) for theory.
